# Deep-Dream

## Aim
To create a "Deep Dream" version of an image, but what exactly is mean't by deep dream? According to google, DeepDream is a computer vision program created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dream-like appearance reminiscent of a psychedelic experience in the deliberately overprocessed images.

## Libraries Used
Tensorflow and Keras

## Dataset Details
A single input image. The image is passed into a pretrained Neural Network.

## Output
Base Image:
